\section{Conclusion}

Using A* search with an admissible heuristic yielded some great results. It is really amazing how a heuristic
can improve search time. But even though the heuristic improved the search time about 400-fold in some
cases, we were still unable to get an answer for the setting that was provided by the staff. This might be 
because there was also some very high-cost terrain surrounding the drill locations in that map, which might
have caused the battery component of the heuristic to steer us the wrong way.

That was another very interesting point. The conditions on the map greatly affect the best heuristic to
choose. We saw how the battery component of our heuristic was detrimental on certain types of maps.

Finally, it would be interesting to further investigate the results of using a nonadmissible heuristic. A way in
which this could be used is in calculating the estimated time spent driving, in order to better account for
non-uniform maps.
